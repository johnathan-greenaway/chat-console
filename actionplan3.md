**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Opportunities:**
```python
# Implement these optimizations:
1. Model Response Caching
   - Cache frequent responses for faster retrieval
   - Implement intelligent cache invalidation
   
2. Lazy Loading Improvements  
   - Only load Ollama client when needed
   - Defer model list fetching until accessed
   
3. Background Operations
   - Move heavy operations to background threads
   - Implement non-blocking model discovery
```

#### 4.2 User Experience Enhancements 🎨
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Features to Add:**
```python
# Enhanced input handling:
1. Command History
   - Up/down arrow navigation through previous messages
   - Command completion for model names
   
2. Multi-line Input Support
   - Enter submits, Shift+Enter for new line
   - Visual indicator for multi-line mode
   
3. Enhanced Search
   - Fuzzy search in conversation history
   - Global search across all conversations
   
4. Quick Actions
   - Copy last response to clipboard
   - Export conversation to file
   - Quick model switching with hotkeys
```

#### 4.3 Developer Experience 🛠️
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Improvements:**
```python
1. Enhanced Logging
   - Structured logging with levels
   - Debug mode for troubleshooting
   
2. Configuration Validation
